Spartan light color scheme
==========================

A very plain color scheme for IntelliJ IDEA focusing on highlighting structure and
errors. All code is of uniform color, only strings and comments have a distinguishing
color. Enhanced navigation and error highlighting.

For dark color scheme, check out [Spartan](https://github.com/teijo/intellij-colors-spartan) in Github.

Rationale
---------

 - IDE's error highlighting capabilities should be given highest visual priority
 - String contents aren't generally validated so they need extra care
 - Comments should exist for a reason, and therefore catch your eye


Installation
------------

Save `.icls` file in disk. Import it in IntelliJ IDEA:

`Preferences -> Color Scheme -> Cog icon -> Import Scheme -> IntelliJ IDEA color scheme (.icls) or settings (.jar)`
